# Heart-Disease-Classification
## Heart Disease Exploratory Data Analysis and Classification on Survey Data Utilising Component Analysis and Machine Learning Methods
### Project Description: 

Heart disease is caused by several factors and it is vital to determine which factor causes it. Gathering 
information of the general public is usually in the form of a survey and is dependent on the groups of respondents as this will 
affect the balance of the class. Real world datasets are generally imbalanced with mixed data types, therefore requiring different 
approaches from visualization to data transformation and modelling. 

This project evaluates different component analysis methods and machine learning models in classifying heart 
disease and determining factors related to it. Comparison between work done by others on this dataset and the chosen 
methods in this project describe relatively similar performance. However, in the medical world, a single metric such as accuracy 
is not sufficient to determine methods' performance. Hence, this project will also delve into additional metrics for a more accurate 
and perhaps situational evaluation of methods.

### Project Details:
1. The project is implemented in R.
2. Dataset used for the project is the ["Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease) dataset.
3. All code used to obtain the results is contained within the ["HeartDisease_DMA.R"](https://github.com/khoryongteng/Heart-Disease-Classification/blob/main/HeartDisease_DMA.R) file.

### Results:
Results obtained can be read on the ["Heart Disease Classification on Survey Data Utilising Component Analysis and Machine Learning Methods.pdf"](https://github.com/khoryongteng/Heart-Disease-Classification/blob/main/Heart%20Disease%20Classification%20on%20Survey%20Data%20Utilising%20Component%20Analysis%20and%20Machine%20Learning%20Methods.pdf) report.

### To run the code yourselves:
1. Run the ["HeartDisease_DMA.R"](https://github.com/khoryongteng/Heart-Disease-Classification/blob/main/HeartDisease_DMA.R) file. Package installations are taken care of within the notebook.
2. File path to datasets may need to be changed.
